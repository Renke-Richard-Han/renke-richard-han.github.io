As a technical lead under 1B revenue product line, I am harmonizing the marketing and technical perspectives with strong business driven mindset.</p> <p>I obtained my Ph.D. degree in power electronics systems from <a href="https://www.energy.aau.dk/laboratories/microgrids-and-energy-internet-laboratory" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aalborg University</a> under Prof. Josep Guerrero, Denmark at 2018. In Spring 2017, I was a Visiting Scholar with Laboratoire d’Automatique , <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/decode/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a> under Prof. Giancarlo Ferrari Trecate, Switzerland. I have been as a Postdoctoral Research Associate under Prof. Daniel Rogers from 2018 to 2021 in Power Electronics Group, <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/power-electronics-group" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a>, U.K.,</p> <p>I received B.S. degree in Automation and M.S degree in Control Theory and Control Engineering from Northeastern University in 2013 and 2015, respectively,in China. Please check my CV for more details.</p> <p>I am always devoted to make contributions to the society to make human beings life better and easier. Hence, I decided to move from Academic to Industry to explore more practical problems. From 08.2021 - 09.2023, as a system enginer (Pure R&amp;D role) for industrial application such as reference design for low/medium power industrial applications from active transistor switching, circuit to control system design, high resolution semiconductor junction temperature monitor, and power module life time estimation.</p> </body></html>
